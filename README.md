# mnpostman

A small "curl" project that aims to provide a template of C code and Makefile to make requests to servers.

# How-to-use
After cloning the repository, you will have to install the GNU make program (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and GCC to compile the code.
Then you can work with executable "mnpostman" by commands such as:

./mnpostman GET www.google.com

Have fun exploring the ancient C code.

# Future
Docker for everyone. No more downloading packages such as GNU Make.
